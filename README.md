This will be my personal website when I am finished with it. It will be using Flask as a backend.

I am learning a lot of python these days, especially for web development, and I highly recommend it.

However, for my blogging solution, I will be using Ghost and host that using a different URL. That will be configured at a later date.

For now, this is a place for me to do experiments with Flask, learn more about the microframework's capabilities, and also practice with Python.

It's great being a developer. Also, I am thinking about doing some streaming via [LiveCoding.tv](http://livecoding.tv/writingpanda). If you're interested in learning more about what I am doing here, check out my stream!

I am also thinking about building a resume static site. That will be more of a test in SASS or just straight CSS. Should be fun! Wish me luck out there!
